# FitnessSite_MERN

 This is the same as my FitnessSite_React_RapidAPI project repository.

 But in this one I made a clone of the ExerciseDB API of RapidAPI and used that instead.

 This is made using MERN stack.

 Note: if the exercise gif images are not visible plz inform me , because i have to update my DB from time to time as per the Rapid API DB
